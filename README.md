# Airport-reservation-System_python

The main purpose of this vision document is to list the requirements of the Airline 
Reservation System project. This document also helps us to collect and analyze the ideas gathered for the project. This vision document will be subject to change, if more requirements are added to the project. This document is mainly prepared to set stage for the design phase of the project. The document being prepared is the first version of vision document for the Airline Reservation System project.


 PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Airline Reservation System project is an implementation of a general Airline 
Ticketing website like Orbitz, which helps the customers to search the availability and prices of various airline tickets, along with the different packages available with the reservations. This project also covers various features like online registration of the users, modifying the details of the website by the management staff or administrator of the website, by adding, deleting or modifying the customer details, flights or packages information. In general, this website would be designed to perform like any other airline ticketing website available online.




There are two kinds of users for the Airline Reservation System. One is the customer and the other is the administrator. The customers do not need to have any prior training to use the application. However, instructions for making flight and motel reservations would be provided to them on the airline website. The administrators would however need to be trained in order to use the application.
